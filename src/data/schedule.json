        "Designers have always been gifted with the skill to navigate change. However, being a great designer alone is only the start of creating change. For designers to maximize the ability to change, we must be more than just great designers: we need to learn to be the enablers of change. We must be intentionally strategic in the way we make, and educate the wider audience about the designer's thought processes. I will be using examples from IDEO's client work and offerings to show how designers can make full use of our gift to make the world a better place."

        "Breaking through the silence requires you to be vulnerable and uncomfortable. You’ve got to be brave enough to crack yourself open and dig up the truth of who you really are and what you really value. Because there is a story inside you that no one else can tell."

Sometimes, even the things we do ourselves (or the things that we don't do) get in our way. This talk will explore common areas of opportunity in our process and the ways we conduct ourselves as designers, leaving the audience with tangible advice on how to assuage these shortcomings in replacement for better processes and ultimately, outcomes."

        "We’ve often seen that taking a human-centred lens and experiencing research first hand can have a large impact on understanding the problem space and influencing the direction of projects and products. As user researchers and UX designers, we’re the lucky ones who get to experience this frequently, but how do we help our teams and stakeholders to take a human-centred lens so that we shift from a purely logical lens to one that embraces empathy? In this presentation, we’ll be looking at how we get non-researchers involved in the research process, and the impact this has on digital transformation journeys and the shifts in mindsets.  Using a range of stories of things that worked (and didn’t work so well) from a range of projects from a government context, we’ll be covering a number of techniques that can be used to bring our stakeholders and teams  directly into the research process, so that they can also live and breath our end user’s experience and develop a better shared understanding of the problem space."
